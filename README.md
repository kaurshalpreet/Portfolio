## Getting Started
This is 3 page application.
Each page has a consistent navigation bar and a sticky footer. Each page has a link to navigate to other pages.

---

"About Me" is the main page about myself and has links to my LinkedIn & Github profiles. There is also a link to my resume just next to Github and linkedIn icons. You need to click on the icons/images which will redirect you to my Github and linkedIn profiles and Resume. You can also find my email address and Contact number on this page.

## Running the Application

[My PORTFOLIO can be accessed here](https://kaurshalpreet.github.io/Portfolio/#/)

The index.html has links to my LinkedIn & Github profiles as well as my email address and Contact number. You can also navigate to portfolio and contact pages.

---

## Responsive Layout
The webpages are designed to be responsive for viewing on mobile devices. On an `xs` screen, content takes up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, some margins on the left and right sides of the screen will be observed.

When viewed on mobile device, the navigation links get collaopsed into a navigation icon. When clicked on the navigation icon, it displays the navigation menu.
